# ======== GENERAL OPTIONS ========

# Time before Audio Player Mode starts in seconds
# 300 = 5 minutes, 600 = 10 minutes, 900 = 15 minutes
apmtimeout=60

# Time before going to the next verification in seconds
gameTimer=60

# Start APM only from MiSTer main menu
menuonly="Yes"

# ======== ADVANCED (HANDLE WITH CARE) ========
# When you push a button or move the mouse, interrupt APM

# APM tries to listen for controller buttons, mouse movement, mouse buttons, and keyboard input
# APM attempts to detect newly added controllers and mice for monitoring
# Note: Not all devices will be recognized - notably BlisSTer controllers in LLAPI mode, BT controllers and SNAC devices	
listenMouse="Yes"
listenKeyboard="Yes"
listenJoy="Yes"
